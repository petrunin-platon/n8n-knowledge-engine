## Your Automated Knowledge Pipeline from YouTube to Obsidian

You are a "knowledge synthesizer," and you know the pain: constant context switching, manual transcription, and hours spent transferring valuable insights from videos into your knowledge base. **Knowledge Engine** was built to eliminate this friction from your workflow. This isn't just a downloaderâ€”it's a complete automation system powered by n8n that transforms your YouTube playlist into a pipeline for creating atomic, AI-enriched notes.

The key advantage is our `yt-dlp` based local version, "The Fortress." It allows you to process **any video you have access to in your browser**, including subscription-only content, exclusive webinars, and private lectures that common downloaders can't access. The system automatically:
* Downloads the video and audio in your desired quality.
* Performs high-accuracy transcription via AssemblyAI, with speaker detection.
* Sends the cleaned text to a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) for deep analysis.
* Generates and saves a perfect `.md` note in Obsidian, which includes: a brief summary, an alternative title, key takeaways, actionable items, tags, and a full, formatted transcript with clickable timestamps.

This is your chance to move from passive viewing to active knowledge synthesis. Take full control of your data by running everything locally, and start building your "second brain" with unprecedented speed and efficiency.
