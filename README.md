You are a "knowledge synthesizer," and you know the pain: constant context switching 😫, manual transcription ✍️, and hours spent transferring valuable insights from videos into your knowledge base. **Knowledge Engine** was built to eliminate this friction from your workflow 💥. This isn't just a downloader—it's a complete automation system powered by n8n that transforms your YouTube playlist into a pipeline for creating atomic, AI-enriched notes 🗒️.

The key advantage is our `yt-dlp` based local version, "The Fortress" 🏰. It allows you to process **any video you have access to in your browser** 🌐, including subscription-only content 🔒, exclusive webinars, and private lectures. The system automatically:
* 📥 **Downloads** the video and audio.
* 🎤 **Performs** high-accuracy transcription via AssemblyAI.
* 🧠 **Analyzes** the text with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM).
* 📝 **Generates** and saves a perfect `.md` note in Obsidian, including a brief summary, key takeaways, actionable items, tags, and a full transcript with clickable timestamps.

This is your chance to move from passive viewing to active knowledge synthesis 🚀. Take full control of your data and start building your "second brain" 🧠 with unprecedented speed and efficiency.

## 🤔 Is This You?


<p align="center">
  <a href="https://ibb.co/0yVDwVDz"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/r2f7Wf7X/2.png" alt="The pain of manual note-taking" border="0" width="1024"></a>
</p>


Regardless of your role, you feel that the most valuable knowledge remains "locked" 🔒 in video format. You spend more time fighting the process than learning and analyzing. Do you recognize yourself?

* **🧠 For Knowledge Synthesizers:** Your "YouTube to Obsidian" pipeline is broken. You waste precious mental energy on manual copying and switching between windows instead of synthesizing ideas and building connections in your second brain.

* **📈 For Competitive Intelligence Analysts:** A competitor's critical webinar is available for only 24 hours ⏳. You're forced to spend hours of your expensive time on manual review because standard tools can't access this exclusive content.

* **✍️ For Content Repurposers:** You're sitting on a goldmine 🪙 of expert video content. But turning it into blog posts and social media updates is a slow, grueling process that bottlenecks your entire content machine.

* **🏢 For Corporate L&D Innovators:** Your company invests thousands in training platforms, but that knowledge is "dark matter" ✨. It's unsearchable, and valuable assets are just collecting digital dust.

### But there's a hidden problem: The "Bad Automation" Trap 🪤

You've tried other services, only to discover their dirty secret: most of them just scrape **free, auto-generated YouTube subtitles** 📉. This creates a cascade of problems:

* **😠 Distorted Meaning:** These captions are riddled with errors. When you feed this "dirty" text to an AI for analysis, you get a distorted summary. Garbage in, garbage out.
* **😶 Incomplete Coverage:** A vast number of videos simply don't have auto-captions, rendering these services useless.
* **🎩 The Illusion of Quality:** You pay for a "premium" service that is essentially just passing you low-quality, publicly available data.

As a result, you either spend hours on manual labor or get a distorted output, missing out on hidden connections and potential **topics for deep research** 🗺️.



## ✨ Key Features


Knowledge Engine is more than just a script; it's a complete system designed for maximum efficiency and control.

* **🌐 Universal Video Access**
    * With "The Fortress" version powered by `yt-dlp`, you can process **any video** available to you in your browser. Forget limitations—work with paid, private, and exclusive content that other tools can't access.

* **🚀 Set-and-Forget Automation**
    * Simply add a video link to your designated YouTube playlist. Knowledge Engine runs on a schedule, detects the new video, and processes it through the entire pipeline without any manual intervention.

* **🎤 High-Fidelity Transcription**
    * We don't rely on low-quality YouTube captions. The system sends the audio to **AssemblyAI** to get a clean, accurate transcript with speaker separation, creating a reliable foundation for quality analysis.

* **🧠 Deep AI Analysis**
    * Get more than just text. A powerful Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes the transcript and generates a brief summary, key takeaways, actionable items, tags, and even an alternative, more insightful title for your note.

* **🗺️ Research Topic Generator**
    * Turn passive knowledge into active inquiry! Knowledge Engine can automatically suggest open-ended questions and deep-dive topics for further research based on the video's content, turning every note into a starting point for new discoveries.

* **🔒 Full Data Ownership and Control**
    * The entire system runs locally on your n8n instance. Your media files and notes are saved directly to your computer in Obsidian. No cloud dependencies, 100% privacy, and complete control over your second brain.

* **🔔 Real-Time Notifications**
    * Stay in the loop without breaking your focus. You'll receive live status updates for each processing stage directly in Telegram.

* **🛠️ Flexible and Customizable**
    * All key parameters (AI prompts, save paths, playlist ID) are managed in a convenient Google Sheet. Advanced users can easily modify the n8n workflow itself to add new integrations.
 


## 👤 Who Is This For?


Knowledge Engine is built for professionals and enthusiasts who refuse to waste their time on routine tasks and strive to extract maximum value from video content. You will get the most benefit if:

* **🧠 You are a Knowledge Synthesizer (PKM Enthusiast)**
    * Your goal is a seamless flow of ideas from video directly into your "second brain." You want to spend your time thinking and building connections, not on manual copying, turning passive viewing into active knowledge synthesis.

* **📈 You are a Competitive Intelligence Analyst**
    * You need to extract actionable analytics from closed webinars and exclusive content *now*, not next week. The speed of insight directly impacts your results and gives you a decisive competitive advantage.

* **✍️ You are a Content Creator or Marketer**
    * Your job is to work smarter, not harder. You're looking for a way to **10x your content stream**, turning a one-hour webinar into dozens of articles, threads, and posts without growing your team.

* **🏢 You are a Corporate Learning & Development (L&D) Professional**
    * You aim to "unlock" the value of expensive training subscriptions. Your goal is to transform a passive video library into an **active, searchable corporate knowledge hub** to prove and increase the ROI on employee development.

## 🚀 Get Started in 4 Simple Steps

Setting up Knowledge Engine is straightforward. The entire process is designed to require no programming skills.

### What You Get After Purchase

Inside your `.zip` archive, you'll find everything you need to get started. This GitHub repository also contains the helper files for a quick setup.

* **3 `.json` files** with the n8n workflows (The Fortress, The Universal, The Cloud).
* **`Installation Guide.pdf`** — A detailed, step-by-step guide with screenshots.
* **Ready-to-use Docker files** (`docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`).
* **Quick-start scripts** (`start.bat`, `stop.bat`, `rebuild.bat` for Windows and scripts for MacOS).

### The 4-Step Setup Process

**Step 1: Purchase and Unpack the Engine**

* If you haven't already, you can purchase the workflows from our official Gumroad page:
    **➡️ [Buy Knowledge Engine on Gumroad](https://pplaton.gumroad.com/l/youtube-to-obsidian)**
* Unzip the downloaded `.zip` archive to a convenient location on your computer.

**Step 2: Set Up Your n8n Environment**

* **If you already have n8n:** Great! You can skip to Step 3.
* **If you don't have n8n:** No problem. We've prepared everything for a quick launch using Docker. **Open the `Installation Guide.pdf`** and follow the simple instructions to install Docker and run n8n using our ready-made scripts. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.

**Step 3: Configure Your Settings**

You don't need to edit the workflow code! All settings are conveniently managed in a Google Sheet.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://ibb.co/My9RrSYQ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZRNh5Xn7/4.png" alt="Google Sheets Configuration" border="0" width="1024"></a>
</p>

1.  **Make a copy** of the Google Sheet template that matches your use case:
    * **[📄 Template for Local Versions (Fortress / Universal)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18dU9lFJhRhl8ijOUN5thZjz0xUAahNNO9NUn1QlFDzw/edit?usp=sharing)**
    * **[📄 Template for Cloud Version (The Cloud)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wfDcGCoUS0N6Nu4BDsks_rwFSXB84rsYXi8D2qSXJY/edit?usp=sharing)**
2.  **Fill out your copy of the sheet:** Carefully enter all the required data: your API keys, YouTube playlist ID, Telegram chat ID, and file paths, following the detailed notes in each cell.

**Step 4: Import, Configure Credentials, and Activate**

1.  **Import the `.json` file** you received after purchase as a new workflow in your n8n instance.
2.  **Set Up Credentials:** Before activating the workflow, you need to save your API keys within n8n. For each service (AssemblyAI, Supabase, Google, etc.), create a corresponding "Credential." This is a one-time setup, and n8n will securely store your keys.
    * *You will find detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create each required Credential in the `Installation Guide.pdf`.*
3.  **Connect Credentials to Nodes:** Open each node that requires authentication (e.g., `AssemblyAI: Upload Audio`, `Log: Processing Started`, etc.) and select the Credential you just created from the dropdown menu.
4.  **Activate** the workflow by toggling the switch to "Active."

✅ **Done!** Your automation is now fully configured and ready to go. Just add any video to your YouTube playlist and watch the magic happen.
