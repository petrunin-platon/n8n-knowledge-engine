This repository contains the installation guide and supplementary files for the Knowledge Engine, a powerful set of n8n templates designed to turn any YouTube video into a structured, AI-enriched note in your Obsidian knowledge base.

This project is for PKM enthusiasts, content creators, and competitive intelligence analysts who want to save dozens of hours by automating their knowledge acquisition pipeline.

The Core Problem
Hours of manual work, inaccurate YouTube auto-captions, and the inability to process private or paid videos turn information gathering into a chore. This engine solves these problems.

‚ú® Key Features
Universal Video Processing: Utilizes a yt-dlp-based workflow to process any video you have access to, including private, members-only, and age-restricted content, by using your own browser cookies.

High-Quality Transcription: Integrates with AssemblyAI to provide transcripts that are an order of magnitude more accurate than standard YouTube captions.

Deep AI Analysis: Goes beyond simple transcription to generate a comprehensive, structured note with an alternative title, summary, key takeaways, action items, tags, and topics for further research.

Flexible & Extensible: Built with future-proof YAML and a modular structure, allowing you to adapt it for local media files or integrate it with other AI agents.

Full Data Sovereignty: The entire yt-dlp workflow runs locally on your own machine via Docker, giving you complete control and privacy over your data.

Multiple Workflows Included: The full package includes three versions: the powerful local yt-dlp engine, a simpler local RapidAPI version, and a bonus cloud-only version with Google Drive integration.
